       "      <td>Tissue semantic segmentation is one of the key tasks in computational\\npathology. To avoid the expensive and laborious acquisition of pixel-level\\nannotations, a wide range of studies attempt to adopt the class activation map\\n(CAM), a weakly-supervised learning scheme, to achieve pixel-level tissue\\nsegmentation. However, CAM-based methods are prone to suffer from\\nunder-activation and over-activation issues, leading to poor segmentation\\nperformance. To address this problem, we propose a novel weakly-supervised\\nsemantic segmentation framework for histopathological images based on\\nimage-mixing synthesis and consistency regularization, dubbed HisynSeg.\\nSpecifically, synthesized histopathological images with pixel-level masks are\\ngenerated for fully-supervised model training, where two synthesis strategies\\nare proposed based on Mosaic transformation and B\\'ezier mask generation.\\nBesides, an image filtering module is developed to guarantee the authenticity\\nof the synthesized images. In order to further avoid the model overfitting to\\nthe occasional synthesis artifacts, we additionally propose a novel\\nself-supervised consistency regularization, which enables the real images\\nwithout segmentation masks to supervise the training of the segmentation model.\\nBy integrating the proposed techniques, the HisynSeg framework successfully\\ntransforms the weakly-supervised semantic segmentation problem into a\\nfully-supervised one, greatly improving the segmentation accuracy. Experimental\\nresults on three datasets prove that the proposed method achieves a\\nstate-of-the-art performance. Code is available at\\nhttps://github.com/Vison307/HisynSeg.</td>\n",

However, SAM's performance often falls short in cross-domain and\\nfew-shot applications. Previous work has performed poorly in transferring prior\\nknowledge from base models to new applications. To tackle this issue, we\\npropose a task-adaptive auto-visual prompt framework, a new paradigm for\\nCross-dominan Few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS). First, a Multi-level Feature\\nFusion (MFF) was used for integrated feature extraction as prior knowledge.\\nBesides, we incorporate a Class Domain Task-Adaptive Auto-Prompt (CDTAP) module\\nto enable class-domain agnostic feature extraction and generate high-quality,\\nlearnable visual prompts. This significant advancement uses a unique generative\\napproach to prompts alongside a comprehensive model structure and specialized\\nprototype computation. While ensuring that the prior knowledge of SAM is not\\ndiscarded, the new branch disentangles category and domain information through\\nprototypes, guiding it in adapting the CD-FSS. Comprehensive experiments across\\nfour cross-domain datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the\\nstate-of-the-art CD-FSS approach, achieving an average accuracy improvement of\\n1.3\\% in the 1-shot setting and 11.76\\% in the 5-shot setting.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Although recent years have witnessed significant advancements in medical\\nimage segmentation, the pervasive issue of domain shift among medical images\\nfrom diverse centres hinders the effective deployment of pre-trained models.\\nMany Test-time Adaptation (TTA) methods have been proposed to address this\\nissue by fine-tuning pre-trained models with test data during inference. These\\nmethods, however, often suffer from less-satisfactory optimization due to\\nsuboptimal optimization direction (dictated by the gradient) and fixed\\nstep-size (predicated on the learning rate). In this paper, we propose the\\nGradient alignment-based Test-time adaptation (GraTa) method to improve both\\nthe gradient direction and learning rate in the optimization procedure. Unlike\\nconventional TTA methods, which primarily optimize the pseudo gradient derived\\nfrom a self-supervised objective, our method incorporates an auxiliary gradient\\nwith the pseudo one to facilitate gradient alignment. Such gradient alignment\\nenables the model to excavate the similarities between different gradients and\\ncorrect the gradient direction to approximate the empirical gradient related to\\nthe current segmentation task. Additionally, we design a dynamic learning rate\\nbased on the cosine similarity between the pseudo and auxiliary gradients,\\nthereby empowering the adaptive fine-tuning of pre-trained models on diverse\\ntest data. Extensive experiments establish the effectiveness of the proposed\\ngradient alignment and dynamic learning rate and substantiate the superiority\\nof our GraTa method over other state-of-the-art TTA methods on a benchmark\\nmedical image segmentation task.

The overall algorithm consists of three main steps of image processing.\\nThese are image pre-processing, image segmentation, and image post-processing.\\nHere in the work, contours are initialized on the solar image and allowed to\\ndeform based on the energy function. As soon as the contour reaches the\\nboundary of the desired object, the energy function gets reduced, and the\\ncontour stops evolving. The proposed algorithm has been applied to few\\nbenchmark datasets and has been compared with the classical technique of object\\ndetection. The results analysis indicates that the proposed algorithm\\noutperforms the results obtained using the existing classical algorithm of\\nobject detection.   \n",

However, SAM's performance often falls short in cross-domain and\\nfew-shot applications. Previous work has performed poorly in transferring prior\\nknowledge from base models to new applications. To tackle this issue, we\\npropose a task-adaptive auto-visual prompt framework, a new paradigm for\\nCross-dominan Few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS). First, a Multi-level Feature\\nFusion (MFF) was used for integrated feature extraction as prior knowledge.\\nBesides, we incorporate a Class Domain Task-Adaptive Auto-Prompt (CDTAP) module\\nto enable class-domain agnostic feature extraction and generate high-quality,\\nlearnable visual prompts. This significant advancement uses a unique generative\\napproach to prompts alongside a comprehensive model structure and specialized\\nprototype computation. While ensuring that the prior knowledge of SAM is not\\ndiscarded, the new branch disentangles category and domain information through\\nprototypes, guiding it in adapting the CD-FSS. Comprehensive experiments across\\nfour cross-domain datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the\\nstate-of-the-art CD-FSS approach, achieving an average accuracy improvement of\\n1.3\\% in the 1-shot setting and 11.76\\% in the 5-shot setting.   \n",
       "4  Although recent years have witnessed significant advancements in medical\\nimage segmentation, the pervasive issue of domain shift among medical images\\nfrom diverse centres hinders the effective deployment of pre-trained models.\\nMany Test-time Adaptation (TTA) methods have been proposed to address this\\nissue by fine-tuning pre-trained models with test data during inference. These\\nmethods, however, often suffer from less-satisfactory optimization due to\\nsuboptimal optimization direction (dictated by the gradient) and fixed\\nstep-size (predicated on the learning rate). In this paper, we propose the\\nGradient alignment-based Test-time adaptation (GraTa) method to improve both\\nthe gradient direction and learning rate in the optimization procedure. Unlike\\nconventional TTA methods, which primarily optimize the pseudo gradient derived\\nfrom a self-supervised objective, our method incorporates an auxiliary gradient\\nwith the pseudo one to facilitate gradient alignment. Such gradient alignment\\nenables the model to excavate the similarities between different gradients and\\ncorrect the gradient direction to approximate the empirical gradient related to\\nthe current segmentation task. Additionally, we design a dynamic learning rate\\nbased on the cosine similarity between the pseudo and auxiliary gradients,\\nthereby empowering the adaptive fine-tuning of pre-trained models on diverse\\ntest data. Extensive experiments establish the effectiveness of the proposed\\ngradient alignment and dynamic learning rate and substantiate the superiority\\nof our GraTa method over other state-of-the-art TTA methods on a benchmark\\nmedical image segmentation task. The code and weights of pre-trained source\\nmodels are available at https://github.com/Chen-Ziyang/GraTa.   \n",
